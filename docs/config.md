# Configuration

This project uses configuration options to set the behavior of its executables.
All executables that use autograder resources use the same configuration infrastructure
and can therefore be configured the same way and with the same options.
See the [Configuration Options section](#configuration-options) for all available options.

Options can be set on the command-line using the `-c`/`--config` flag.
For example:
```
./bin/logs-example --config log.level=debug
```

Options can also be set using environmental variables by prefixing the option keys
with `AUTOGRADER__` and replacing any `.` with `__`.
For example option key `docker.disable` can be set by:
```
AUTOGRADER__DOCKER__DISABLE='true' ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

## Directories

The primary directory the autograder will use for storing information is referred to as the "work directory",
and is set to `<base dir>/<instance name>`.
Most other paths are configured to be relative to the work directory.

The base directory is set through the `dirs.base` option,
and defaults to `$XDG_DATA_HOME`.

The instance name is a way to configuration a unique name for your autograder instance.
It can be set with the `instance.name` option,
and defaults to `autograder`.

## Loading Options

Configurations will be loaded in the following order (later options override earlier ones):
 0. The command-line options are checked for `BASE_DIR`.
 1. Load options from environmental variables.
 2. Options are loaded from `WORK_DIR/config` (config.json then secrets.json).
 3. Options are loaded from the current working directory (config.json then secrets.json).
 4. Options are loaded from any files specified with `--config-path` (ordered by appearance).
 5. Options are loaded from the command-line (`--config` / `-c`).

The base directory (`dirs.base`) can ONLY be set via the command-line or environmental variables.
This prevents cycles from the base directory changing and loading new options.

## Configuration Options

Below are all configuration options available for the autograder server.
You can also see all available options by looking in the [config/options.go](../internal/config/options.go) file,
or using the `cmd/list-options` executable.
```
go run cmd/list-options/main.go
```

# Autograder Server

[![Main](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-server/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-server/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A server for automatically (and in real-time) grading programming assignments.

The autograding effort is broken into three main parts:
 1. The autograding server that can accept student submissions, run the assignment graders, and provide feedback to students.
    This repository implements that server.
 2. The interfaces through which users can interact with the autograding server.
    Since the autograding server interacts via a REST API, the requirements for an interface are very low.
    Currently, the [autograder-py Python package](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-py) is the only official interface package.
 3. Course and assignment configurations, including graders to score student submissions.
    These materials should generally be kept private (since they include grading information),
    but we have made a [sample course](https://github.com/edulinq/cse-cracks-course) available.

## Installation

This project uses Go 1.21.
Development and deployment are intended for a Linux environment,
but all Go code is written in a platform independent fashion.

By default, assignments are graded using Docker.
Therefore when grading functionality is used,
Docker should be installed on the machine and accessible to the current user without additional permissions.
Users without Docker can run the server without Docker (see below).

The project adheres to standard Go standards,
so the `go` tool can be used to build, test, manage, etc.
Additionally, the `build.sh` script is provided which will build all executables in this project.

```
./build.sh
```

All executable mains are kept in the `cmd` directory.
Each includes a usage and responds to the `--help` flag.

## Running Executables

Once built, all executables are available in the `bin` directory and can be run directly.
For development, these executables can also be run via `go run`, which will rebuild them if necessary before running:
```
go run cmd/version/main.go
```

## Configuration

This project uses configuration options to set the behavior of its executables.
All executables that use autograder resources use the same configuration infrastructure
and can therefore be configured the same way and with the same options.

To see all the available options,
either look in the [config/options.go](config/options.go) file,
use the `cmd/list-options` executable.
```
./bin/list-options
```

Options can be set on the command-line using the `-c`/`--config` flag.
For example:
```
./bin/logs-example --config log.level=debug
```

### Directories

The primary directory the autograder will use for storing information is referred to as the "work directory",
and is set to `<base dir>/<instance name>`.
Most other paths are configured to be relative to the work directory.

The base directory is set through the `dirs.base` option,
and defaults to `$XDG_DATA_HOME`.

The instance name is a way to configuration a unique name for your autograder instance.
It can be set with the `instance.name` option,
and defaults to `autograder`.

### Loading Options

Configurations will be loaded in the following order (later options override earlier ones):
 0. The command-line options are checked for `BASE_DIR`.
 1. Load options from environmental variables.
 2. Options are loaded from `WORK_DIR/config` (config.json then secrets.json).
 3. Options are loaded from the current working directory (config.json then secrets.json).
 4. Options are loaded from any files specified with `--config-path` (ordered by appearance).
 5. Options are loaded from the command-line (`--config` / `-c`).

The base directory (`dirs.base`) can ONLY be set via the command-line or environmental variables.
This prevents cycles from the base directory changing and loading new options.

### Key Configuration Options

Here are several key configurations you should be aware of:

 - `instance.name` -- A name for this autograder instance.
 - `dirs.base` -- The "base" data directory for the autograder.
    Caches, databases, and other files will be stored here.
 - `server.backup.dir` -- The location that course backups will be saved to.
 - `log.level` -- The logging level. Should be one of ["trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal"].

## Preparing for Grading

Before the server is ready to grade student submissions,
you may have to take some steps depending on your server and assignments.

### Docker Grading

If using the standard Docker-based grading,
then you should take two steps before starting the server for grading.

First, ensure that any required Docker images are accessible for building.
The required images depend on what courses you are hosting,
but the default images live in the [autograder-docker](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-docker) repository.

Second, you will want to pre-build your grader images.
This step is not required as the autograder will ensure that grader images are up-to-date before running a grader,
but this will ensure that the first student to submit is not stuck with a long wait.
Building images can be done using the `cmd/build-images` executable,
which will build images for all known assignments.

```
./bin/build-images
```

### Non-Docker Grading

When Docker is not available,
users can choose to run the server without Docker.
Non-Docker grading will only work when the default Python grader is used.
Also note that running the grader without Docker is a potential security risk
and should be avoided in production.

To disable docker, set the `docker.disable` config option to `true`.

The [Python autograder interface](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-py) must be installed for the non-Docker grader to work:
```
pip install autograder-py
```

## Running the Server

The main server is available via the `cmd/server` executable.
The `web.port` config option can be used to set the port the server listens on:
```
./bin/server -c web.port=80
```

If you want to run on a privileged port as a non-root user,
we recommend using [setcap](https://man.archlinux.org/man/setcap.8).
The `setcap.sh` script will do this for you:
```
./setcap.sh
```

## Running Tests

This repository comes with several types of tests.
All these tests are run in the CI,
and can also be run using the `./.ci/run_all.sh` script:
```
./.ci/run_all.sh
```

Users may also choose to run them individually.

### Installing the Python Interface

Some tests require the Python interface to be installed.
For general users, installing via pip is sufficient:
```
pip install autograder-py
```

For developers who need the latest version, a script in the `./ci` directory can be used to install from source:
```
./.ci/install-py-interface.sh
```

### Base Tests

The base tests are created with Go's `testing` standard library package,
and can therefore be run using `go test`.
The `test.sh` script runs `go test` for each package:
```
./test.sh
```

### Remote Tests

Remote tests are tests that start an instance of the autograder server,
sends the server test submissions via the Python interface,
and ensures that the response matches the expected output.

To find test submissions, the `_tests` directory will be searched for `assignment.json` files.
Then, an adjacent `test-submissions` directory is looked for.

```
./.ci/run_remote_tests.sh
```

### Verifying Python Test Data

As part of the tests for the Python interface,
the test suite will mock an autograder server using pre-scripted responses.
To ensure that these responses are correct, this repository can run an official autograder server and
validate that the pre-scripted responses matches the real responses.

```
./.ci/verify-py-test-data.sh
```
